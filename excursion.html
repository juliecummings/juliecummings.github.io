Hopefully, opening our eyes to these interactive installations and technologies might provide us with some indication or insight into what we could accomplish during the lab weeks. Plus, each of us will take away something unique to ourselves &mdash; what appealed to us, what did not and why.<br><br><br> </p>

                There were an abundance of intriguing interactive displays, some of which I still find worth mentioning in my 
                <b><a class="words portfolio-item" href="#portfolio-modal-3">reflection</a></b>
                . It was a tough choice but at the end of the trip, I have decided to go with this (shown on the bottom left image) as the installation I personally found most interesting in an interactive and technological sense. I will now talk about its goal, how it works and also tell you why it won me over.<br><br>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/excursion/chosen.png" alt="">

                <br><br>First and foremost, this is part of the 'Teen Facts' exhibition in Humania, on the fourth floor. Humania allows us to find out what makes us human by discovering the importance of our brain as well as our uniqueness &mdash; an instance depicting this distinction is our behaviours and mannerisms. 
                
                <h5>MY CHOICE:</h5><h4>I DARE YOU / WIE DURFT?</h4>

                The goal of this installation is to demonstrate the risk-taking behaviour most typical amongst teens, even more so with the male. There was also an accompanying installation that invites you to "discover your limits by playing Electro Roulette" which is as it sounds &mdash; receive shocks in a roulette fashion.
                <br><br>In alignment with living dangerously and pushing things to the limit, there are three hidden tubes with a huge "I dare you" sign embossed at the top. The first activation is when someone walks past the installation, it expels an air blast and an accompanying hasty sound. The first tube extends all the way to the other side. The second tube vibrates when a hand (or anything else) is placed in it. The third tube has a metal horizontal pole in it and with some delay, a rubber snake pops up to make a lighted-up unexpected appearance in a see-through window.
                <br><br>It works by using three motion sensors placed at the side and in the walls of the two tubes. For the first interaction, the sensor is located in a tiny peephole and a small burst of pressurized air gets released above it when it detects motion. However, there seems to be a five to ten seconds recharge period following this expulsion where nothing happens. Whether there is the addition of audio or it is just audio feedback from the abrupt spurt is unclear to me. The second tube consists of a hidden sensor somewhere in the walls of it which is then connected to a motor. This motor starts up, creating vibrations across the cylinder, when it receives input from the sensor. With the far right tube, there is a metal pole, spanning horizontally across the circumference, that aids in instigating sensory assumptions as it is cool to the touch. I initially believed that tugging or yanking the pole was needed but it was not the case. I concluded that it is another motion sensor within the walls of the cylinder as the tube is smooth upon inspection. Once motion is detected, the lights illuminate and the rubber snake is lifted up. Judging by the way it pops up, which is in an arc-like manner, I would surmise that it utilises some sort of crank / crankshaft. Whether done intentionally or not, there is a ten seconds (relatively long) delay before the snake appears in the small circular window.<br><br>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/excursion/sketches.png" alt="">

                <br><br>Although it might not involve the most complex of technologies as compared to numerous other installations there, I find it fascinating the effect that what little technology has on behaviour and responses. I am amazed at how a simple concept can take root effectively with the right applications. Essentially, I am irrevocably interested at how simply it is able to simultaneously inspire curiousity and invoke cautious and doubt.<br><br>

                <h5>&#8902; LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE EXCURSION &#8902;</h5>
                Through this visit to the NEMO Science Museum, I got a glimpse into installations and all it entails. There is not only the concept and its accompanying technologies to see it through, but also a corresponding brief instructions and explanation as they should be self explanatory. Also, there is the consideration of its usage of space. For instance, having smaller installations placed in close proximity can support the main point being put across or in certain cases, the use of space should be appraised in aiding the execution of an installation. To elaborate more specifically on the important usage of surrounding space, there are these following installations: <br><br>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/excursion/catch.gif" alt="">
                <br><br> The mirror installation (involving one person standing at each end, looking at the other) displays the idea that half of you only virtually existed, which was an intriguing notion. This would be less effective if the mirror did not have the length. With the second example, it uses the manipulation of space to provide an illusion of interaction with the holographic projection. The pulley installation applies constrast placed side by side to enhance its point. With the mirrored projection of self, the installation utilises an enclosed space with darkness and a folded-in corner which adds to the value of the exhibition. Last but not least, I was observing this physical interaction Sunbel had with an installation. While she positioned herself as seen, I noticed that users were expected to stand on the pedestal provided, which would have made for a much more challenging experience. All in all, space matters!
                <br><br>
                <h5>&#8902; WHAT SPOKE TO ME &amp; WHAT DID NOT &#8902;</h5>
                I was a fan of the aforementioned installation Sunbel partook in because of the hands-on aspect it offers. Rather than watching or contributing in minor actions, this required active participation and incites a challenge. Through this exploration of installations in NEMO Science Museum, I realized that, in general, I am not particularly drawn to the more passive interations. Additionally, I was not as taken by the space installation titled 'bescherm de aarde' or 'protect Earth' in English as shown below. I can see its appeal but it simply did not make me do a double take. Additionally, I found the holographic projection where one uses sandbags to direct the flow of water rather slow in responsiveness and my attention was swiftly lost. On the other hand, the similar installation (with actual water) next to this one which involves creating a dam from orange blocks so you can conduct water through a mill was much more entertaining to me. I feel this is largely due to the tangible aspect it offers. I learnt that the tactile qualities spoke to me more than I anticipated. As such, it is a facet I should keep in mind.<br><br>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/excursion/spoke.gif" alt="">
                <br><br>Above are two installations from the 'Teen Facts' exhibition, part of the Humania exhibition floor, that I found myself lingering on. The first that spoke to me was a setup of a slouchy teenager with a television as a head and instead of headphones, as is the usual medium utilised, it voices out through a telephone. I feel that the entire display was well thought through. The second was a french kissing display where two hands mimick tongues. Essentially, I concluded that these installations appeals to me mainly due to my fascination with psychology. As first impressions go, the execution and presentation intrigues me and drew me in. Only after do I ponder over the technologies (if any).<br><br>
                <h5>&#8902; WAYS THE EXCURSION WAS VALUABLE &#8902;</h5>
                First and foremost, it was eye-opening and fun. Subsequently, I believe the value of the excursion lies mostly in the exposure to interactive installations, which better prepares us for what is to be expected of us at the EXPO concluding the end of Lab Weeks. It also gave me various aspects contributing to an engaging installation that should be considered before entering the Lab Weeks. As it has been ages since I last visited such a venue, it was something unexpected at every turn which really broaden my horizon. Key points I would take away are whilst imagining what could be done with technolgies available, one should not neglect to consider the usage of space, the possibilities of tactile qualities as well as not overlooking the execution and presentation of an installation.<br><br>
