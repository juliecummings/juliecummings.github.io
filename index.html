             I expect this course to be different. Whilst User Experience can still come into play, I welcome the more hands-on approach for a change. I also anticipate there to be numerous struggles but also fun tasks. Although I am not the best with technology, I enjoy the challenge. I shall take pride and be amazed at what I can end up doing.<br> <br> I imagine this course will give chances for me to practise and improve on my programming capabilites. Plus, I have always been enthusiastic about physics. As such, I hope that I get to learn as well as play with circuitry and create wonderful things with them. All in all, I want to fathom the possibilities new technologies can create for future designs by understanding what it can accomplish for design now.</p>

            <h6> For an excursion, we visited NEMO science museum in Amsterdam.<br></h6>

            <p>The creative mind behind NEMO, built in 1997, is Italian architect Renzo Piano. He had a clear vision for his design of the NEMO building, with its very own piazza 22 metres above water level. The spectacular roof terrace has a magnificent view over Amsterdam and the Eastern Docklands. <br>

            <br><h6>NEMO SCIENCE MUSEUM IN AMSTERDAM</h6>
            On the banks of the river IJ lies the futuristic NEMO: the Walhalla for every curious soul who likes to experiment. The building has the shape of a giant green ship and is clearly recognizable from afar. NEMO Science Museum introduces the world of science and technology using a variety of playful interactions / exhibitions. The museum calls itself a science centre, but that does not mean that lay people have nothing to look for &mdash; on the contrary! NEMO makes science and technology fun, exciting and accessible. One visit to this centre and physics suddenly doesn't seem that complicated anymore.<br>

            <br><h6>Fenomena &#8902; Technium &#8902; Elementa &#8902; Humania &#8902; Energetica</h6>
            Discover how things work with five-storeys of NEMO. No dull lessons, but doing, seeing, feeling and experiencing. Lock yourself in a self-blown bubble, cycle over a cable three meters in the air, explore your DNA with a 3D journey through your body and get to know <i>Electra</i>, Europe's largest human robot.</p>

        <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
        <p class="text-center"> Lab Weeks consists of two weeks / nine days in which we work continuously and intensively on our interactive concept in groups of five students. Doing so in a location outside of the Haagse Hogeschool (at Maakhaven) gives us a special space to put us in a mindframe to fully focus on devising and building our interactive installation. Each of us were asked to select our preferences on the four topics and groups were formed taking this into account. Within the topic, we were tasked with researching new concepts, applications, interaction forms, user experiences and a whole lot of 'tinkering'. These interactive installations had to be designed in such a way that they can be presented in an exhibition with which we conclude these lab weeks.<br><br> </p>

              Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is intended for artists, designers and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments. Arduino consists of an open source micro-controller and a software environment to program it in. Arduino projects can run stand-alone (without a computer), but can also communicate with software that runs on a computer (eg Processing, MaxMSP). Arduino boards are able to read inputs &mdash; light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message &mdash; and turn it into an output &mdash; activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
              <br><br>Here is an 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a></b> on Arduino or simply 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage" target="_blank">get started</a></b>.

              <br><br><img class="img-fluid" src="img/workshops/arduino/generic.png" alt="">

              
              <br><br>For the following assignments, an Arduino Uno board was used. I was provided with an 
              <b><a class="words" href="img/workshops/arduino/arduinoManualv5.pdf" target="_blank">Arduino Manual v5.0</a></b> containing 13 exercises with sub-exercises. Some of which are shown below.
              <br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212;
              <h5>EXERCISE 3C</h5>
              Exercise 3 is about manipulating multiple LEDs as this was the first introduction of a second LED. After figuring out how to make an individual LED turn off and on, I experimented with the delays and learnt how to make one blink. As a natural progression, I proceeded with making two such LEDs blink with respect to each other. I first attempted to make them blink stimultaneously followed by, in turns. This particular sub-exercise, exercise 3c, was about making one LED blink twice as fast as the other. Below is a simple illustration I made to clearly describe the understanding of how this works.<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/illustration.png" alt="">

              <br><br>Above depicts visually the four steps needed in order to achieve this. LED 1 and 2 are on HIGH aka switched on. Next, LED 1 and 2 are on LOW aka switched off. After, only LED 1 (the faster LED) is on HIGH while LED 2 is on LOW. Lastly, both LEDs are on LOW and this cycle repeats itself in a loop. The video on the far right is of my initial outcome while the video on the left and its accompanying code are a result of shortening the delays which I did just because I can and I liked how it looked.
              <br><br>THE RESULTING CODE AND PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION IS AS FOLLOWS:<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/3.gif" alt="">


              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 4C</h5>
              Exercise 4 asks that I make one LED gradually light up whilst the other gradually dims down. This exercise brings forth the use of the analogWrite() function which allows me to set the brightness of an LED from 0 (completely off) to 255 (completely on) or anywhere in between. In order for an LED to slowly fade from 0 to 255, a for loop is utilized. In the process of figuring exercise 4c out, I hit a roadbump when I tried to implement a second variable that decreases as opposed to increases into my for loop. Whilst it worked physical for this purpose, I was told that as a general rule of thumb, one does not do such a thing. Still curious about my mistake, I searched the why not of it all after the workshop. As it turns out, it complicates the parameters set within the for loop and wires (variables) will inevitably get criss-crossed. As such, I further discovered that a nested for loop was a possible solution for such a predicament. Irregardless, a simpler solution for the current exercise at hand was to simply take the dewindling LED as the inverse of the illuminating LED by substracting the brightness variable from 255 (the maximum brightness) as seen in the provided code shown below.
              <br><br>THE RESULTING CODE AND PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION IS AS SUCH:<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/4.gif" alt="">


              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 6C</h5>
              After previously playing around with using a potmeter value as an analog input by viewing it on the serial monitor and serial plotter, exercise 6 is about controlling an LED with a potmeter. More specifically, making an LED dim or illuminate gradually using a potmeter. To make one LED fade in while the other fades out and vice versa, the analogWrite() function used are similar to that of exercise 4. The difference being that in order to use the analog input received by the potmeter which is on a scale of 0 to 1023 to control the LEDs, the value must first be scaled down to the value of 0 to 255 of which an LED is controlled by. Due to this scaling, the variable sensorValue must be changed to a float as opposed to an integer. The sensor value can be manually scaled down or the map() function can be incorporated. The syntax of this function is map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh) where 'value' is the number to map which in this case is the sensorValue, 'fromLow' is the lower bound of the value’s current range, 'fromHigh' is the upper bound of the value’s current range, 'toLow' is the lower bound of the value’s target range and 'toHigh' is the upper bound of the value’s target range.

              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/6.gif" alt="">


              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 7</h5>
              Exercise 7 aims to control the LEDs with light using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). An LDR is another kind of sensor and it is a sensitive resistor that measures the amount of light which works like the sensors used to turn street lights on when it gets dark outside. The objective is to make the LEDs fade according to the amount of light that the LDR perceives. Just like with the potmeter, the LDR sensor value, under ideal circumstances, ranges between 0 to 1023. However, the actual range the sensor reaches under my personal lighting conditions would likely be a lot smaller to account for less than optimal variables. To obtain the measured range in practice, I noted down the highest (unobscured) and lowest (obscured) value gathered through the serial monitor. I then used the map() function to define the actual range and to rescale it to the 0-255 range the LEDs accept. Subsequently, I was greeted by blinking LEDs that happened as a result of the sensor value being out of range. As it turns out, the light will completely turn on when the sensor value is a negative number, causing the unanticipated flickering. In order to remedy this, I incorporated the constrain() function to make sure the number is never lower than 0. All functions used (and more) with their accompanying syntax and parameters can be further read up on in the 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/" target="_blank">reference</a></b> on Arduino's site.

              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 8</h5>
              Exercise 8 plays around with the notion of a voltage divider. A voltage divider is a circuit that turns a large input voltage (maximum 5V with the Arduino Uno used) into a smaller output one. Using two resistors and an input voltage, we can create an output voltage that is a fraction of the input. In this exercise, variable resistors, namely Light Dependant Resistors, are used instead of pre-determined ones. When placed in the dark, the resistor should be quite high (approximately 5MΩ or 5000000Ω) and when placed in bright light, it should be quite low (approximately 200Ω). Of course, these numericals are derived with the assumption of ideal circumstances.<br><br>

              The theory is that based off of knowing the input voltage and the resistance range (in the dark and in bright light), I will be able to use the formula below to calculate output voltage, which will then be reflected in the brightness of the LEDs. Theoretically, there are 4 test cases that can be verify this voltage divider / reduction notion by using said formula.
              <br><br><img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/physics.png" alt="">

              <br><br><b>TEST CASE 1 &mdash; LDR1 is obscured (in the dark) and the LDR2 is unobscured (in bright light).</b> <br>In such a scenario, the reduced output voltage should be approximately 0.0002 V, as proven in the calculations above. The lower voltage should result in dimmer LEDs.

              <br><br><b>TEST CASE 2 &mdash; LDR1 is unobscured (in bright light) and the LDR2 is obscured (in the dark).</b> <br>In this scenario, the output voltage should reflect 4.99V based on the following calculated estimations. This should bring about brighter LEDs.

              <br><br><b>TEST CASE 3 &mdash; LDR1 and LDR2 are both obscured (in the dark).</b> <br>From calculations made off of the given formula, the output voltage should be 2,5V. This is also consistent with the implication that two resistors of the same value would result in an output voltage that is half of the input voltage.

              <br><br><b>TEST CASE 4 &mdash; LDR1 and LDR2 are both unobscured (in bright light).</b> <br>Just like with test case 3, the output voltage should be 2,5V which once again supports that two resistors of the same value would result in an output voltage that is half of the input voltage.

              <br><br>To test out this theory in practice, I first watch the brightness of the LEDs as the aforementioned test cases were set in motion. Once I was remotely satisfied with the results, I further supported my assumptions through the serial monitor which was scaled down to fit the voltage scale (0-5). In the video provided below, LDR1 is the one shown on the top while LDR2 is the one below it. With regards to test case 1, it was tabulated at approximately 0.5V. With test case 2, it was recorded at around 4.7V. As of test cases 3 and 4, output voltage for both were monitored to be roughly between the range of 2.4V to 2.6V. All of which is in sync with my previously stated theory-based predictions. The slight discrepancies can be accounted for by factoring in that the conditions are sub-optimal at best.

              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/8.gif" alt="">


              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 9B</h5>
              Up to now, Arduino has only be seen to work standalone. For exercise 9, the Arduino board is used as an input device for the computer by creating a connection between Arduino and Processing. Essentially, the input is passed through the Arduino onto a Processing sketch. This was intimidating to begin with but turned out to be a joy to play with. In the following moving images, I displayed what is happening on the Arduino board itself and how it is brought over to the processing sketch. What I did is to make the placement of the triangles to be determined by the input of the sensor (the potmeter) value. As the potmeter (input) is turned from one end to the other, the triangles move across the screen (output) in the display window. I also played with distinguishing the speed of each triangle by manipulating (multiplying and dividing) the sensor value input that influences the position of the triangle respectively.

              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 10F</h5>
              Exercise 10 is all buttons! A button is debatably the simplest kind of sensor. A button functions by closing a circuit and this can be sensed by the Arduino. In an array of sub-exercises, I practiced using buttons in different ways. In exercise 10f, the final sub-exercise, I was tasked with creating two button interactions where the LED lights up when either one button of the two buttons is pressed but does not when both is pressed. I did so using an if…​else statement. I grouped the possibilities into two: first group being what would result in the LED lighting up. This happens when the top button is pressed and the bottom is not or the bottom button is pressed and the top is not. I also considered including an else if for a second condition which essentially breaks it up into three subsets but settled on it being redundant. However, I observed that the LED would flicker once no matter what I tried. I eventually accepted it as a result of not being able to press both buttons simultaneously.

              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 11B</h5>
              The introduction of servo motors is made in exercise 11. More specifically, I was acquainted with the SG90 servo motor which has a rotation span of 160&#176;. The servo is controlled by a special code library. Libraries can be imported by citing "#include <.h>" where the name of the library is inserted followed by dot 'h'. The aim in part b of this exercise is to change the code in a way that the servo will move in a more interesting way &mdash; a funny, rhythmical way, or even teach it how to dance! As I was pondering my favourite songs, I noticed most of them were of a fixed tempo so I tried to make the servo switch direction based on the stress of the words. I eventually went with this song as it was fun to do the twitchy part in sync (close enough) with the singing. This can be found at 00:17 of the video clip. Enjoy!

              <h5>EXERCISE 12B</h5>
              In exercise 12, I attempted controlling the servo with inputs &mdash; first with a potmeter and then with two buttons. I started of with fusing what was done in exercise 10 and 11. The result was one button brings the servo motor from 0 to 160 and the other from 160 to 0 with one press (and release). A downside to this is the inability to halt the servo mid-route and that it always has to begin or end at 0 or 160. Not quite satisfied with this, I tried an alternative route that does not pre-define the position as a fixed 0 or 160. As opposed to using a for statement for the positon, I constrain the position variable to be within the acceptable range. With this subsequent code, it requires a press and hold to control the servo. Plus, it can change course within the range of 0 and 160. Hence, I prefer the second option as I feel it provides more autonomy or control on the users' part.

              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/workshops/arduino/12.gif" alt="">


              <br><br><br><h5>EXERCISE 13B</h5>
              Exercise 13 is all about sound! I had big dreams with this exercise! Firstly, the Arduino board can produce sound when connected to a speaker. This happens with a so-called Piezo speaker (looks like a small black cylinder) that consists of a plate of two different metals that can vibrate and produce sound as such. Each note has a unique frequency. After much deliberation of the huge range of song choices, I went with 'The Final Countdown' by Europe as the tune is so memorable and I found it fitting as this marks the final exercise of the Arduino workshop. While finding out the notes for the song was simple enough, I struggled with the timing &mdash; both the duration of the tune and the pauses in between. It kept being too fast or too slow and I could not quite find a middle ground. Eventually, I found a tempo set by someone else and incorporated it. All in all, I am ecstatic with the outcome!

              <h5>SPATIAL AUGMENT REALITY:</h5> <h4>PROJECTION MAPPING WITH MADMAPPER</h4>
              We were instructed to take one of the tempex (piepschuim) objects and create a cool interactive projection
              mapping for it. Requirements for this assignment included having more than one video and incorporating some element of interactivity. <br><br>

              <br><br>Above is a screenshot of our experimentation. This was done alongside Angelika Simonfalvi and Alzbeta Selepova. We incorporated two videos and utilized one audio clip for the first interactivity. The louder the audio, the brighter the video. Secondly, by pressing the 'G' key, it switches to the next video. We also learnt how to mask the videos such that it is in the shape of the tempex object. The following video is taken by Angelika Simonfalvi. <br><br>

              I feel that my understanding of Unreal Engine is not quite there and I struggled with how to proceed with this assignment. Regardless, I am more than willing to learn. Hence, I decided to continue on this tutorial journey. In this Unreal Engine 4 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/504-unreal-engine-4-materials-tutorial" target="_blank">Materials Tutorial</a></b> by Tommy Tran, I learnt how to modify textures in the material editor, create material instances and update material instances during gameplay.<br><br>

              <br><br>This virtual world is a slight step up from the previous two assignments. Essentially, the pawn changes form (colour) with each banana it consumes in gameplay. Users are expected to collect bananas and with enough collected, the pawn / player takes on its fully evolved formed. It is also more aesthetically pleasing with the incorporation of variation in colours (of the bananas and cube). One can simply add challenge by only consuming one or two colours of bananas.

              <br><br>Realistically, the purpose of the aforementioned virtual world is the foster my understanding of Unreal Engine 4. It is unlike any software I have utilized with a complex interface that is taxing to acclimatize to. I appear to be adapting to the functionalities and many windows at a slower pace than I had hope. My first thought when I saw the assignment was to make a game like that of 'snake', only the cube eats the bananas and get longer and longer. Upon collision, game is over. Then I realised I do not know how to change the player based on conditions (eating bananas) and how to make the bananas pop up mid game. Plus, I have no idea where to begin with keeping score or have a timer which was depressing to come to terms with. As such, I hope to continue on these tutorials as these 3 are part of a 10-part tutorial series on Unreal Engine for beginners. Ones I am looking forward to trying are the

              <h5>FINDING OUT OUR GROUPS. GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. BRAINSTORMING IDEAS. CREATING THREE CONCEPTS. <br>MONDAY. 3 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              I was ecstatic to find out that I got allocated my first choice of topic and started assembling with my group. Today, we spent the first hours with a kick-off briefing, finding out our group and getting to know each other a little. Other then being acquainted, I yearn to find out more about each other’s strengths so we would have roles to play accordingly. I found out that Hernan is a web developer and is proficient in programming. Other than this, it proved impossible as the group was eager to begin. As such, I initiated by sharing my research into Artificial Creatures. No one followed suit and I sensed that everyone were keen on brainstorming of the top of our heads. Hence, we began brainstorming ideas in the form of a mind map. Once we were satisfied with the quantity, we narrowed down the options to three ideas by means of stating our preferences. The three ideas we liked were a Venus flytrap, WALL-E and Dragons. <br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day1.png" alt="">
              
              <br><br>We further developed each of these concepts as well as started discussing about what set up and technologies could help us achieve these concepts. For instance, using leap motion to control drones that will provide a ‘dragon’ with flight. As we played around with the ideas more, the scales seemed to tip towards the Venus Flytrap idea. Eventually, we decided to bring over the idea of collecting trash from WALL-E to a Venus flytrap. Instead of catching flies, it catches trash. 

              Subsequently, we ordered some hardware from Tinytronics (battery pack, 360 servo motor and a 16 by 32 LED matrix) so we could tinker tomorrow. I felt the day could have went better as there was little order and direction, resulting in a less than optimal amount of progress made. At the end of the day, we thought that we should set aside time near the end of the day for planning the agenda of the next day whilst the progress is still fresh in our minds so that we can start promptly the next morning.

              <br><br><br><h1>2</h1><br>
              <h5>MAKING ROUGH SKETCHES OF THE IDEA. FACE DETECTION EXPERIMENTATION. PLAYING WITH SERVO MOTORS. EMOTIONS. <br>TUESDAY. 4 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              Today began the incorporation of morning standups where we each discussed our progress and what needs to be done moving forward still. Additionally, we updated our scrum board with more specific tasks as we have some direction to head towards. Larissa and I made rough sketches of the design we have in mind. Hernan tried out face detection as we intend to sync it with the movement of our robot. We considered other options instead of locating an individual's face. Patrick played around with servo motors, trying to think of ways to make our robot move as intended. After which, we decided we needed pan-tilt brackets for that. Subsequently, we discussed and settled upon using its eyes and respective colours to show its emotions. We mapped out how the eyes will look per each emotion. Wendy did so for an angry expression while I did so for neutral, sad and happy. <br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day2.gif" alt="">

              <br><br>Whilst sketching these, I started pondering animation possibilities using frames of the illustrated emotion. We received the hardware we ordered and it took a while but eventually, Hernan and Patrick figured out how to connect the Arduino to the LED matrix. As it seemed tedious, I initiated a cheat code of sorts where I jotted down the connections which came in handy in the next couple of days when a jumper wire comes loose. Next, the test codes for the LED matrix were a success and about time as the day was coming to a close. Earlier in the day, Hernan and Wendy felt that they would prefer to also have a digital version of the scrum board for personal use. Lastly, we decided it productive to add assignees and prioritization to each of our tasks on Trello which I executed, wrapping up our exploratory day. I was pleasantly satisfied with the productivity of the day, considering we are still in the elementary stages of our process.
              <h5>+ GUEST LECTURE ON AR PROJECTS.</h5>
              The guest lecture was Vincent Lindeboom from 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://nextempire.net/" target="_blank">Next Empire</a></b>. He was energetic and inspirational. I liked that he also gave his own inspiration, 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://studiomoniker.com/" target="_blank">studio Moniker</a></b>, which was indeed nice to check out. Additionally, he is recently enterprising in a pop-up DJ bar in Amsterdam's Westerpark called

              <h5>LINKING FACE DETECTION TO SERVO MOTORS. POSSIBILITY OF USING RED DOT DETECTION INSTEAD. PROJECT EMOTIONS TEMPLATE ONTO LED MATRIX. START COLLECTION OF BOTTLE CAPS / CAN TABS. <br>WEDNESDAY. 5 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              Today is about trying to link the pan-tilt servo motors to the current face detection setup. As we are still uncertain about the effectiveness of the face detection (especially when it comes to detecting the closest person), we considered using red dot detection as an alternative. Also, I completed the illustrations of all the emotions I was tasked on a pixel grid, prepped by transferrence, but we still needed to find a way to project the illustrated emotions onto the RGB LED matrix. <br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day3.gif" alt="">

              <br><br>Additionally, we should think about which colours best suit the various emotions as a group because currently, everyone has their own opinion on the matter. As Wendy initially thought it possible to use a software only available to Windows, which turned out to be a dead end, we were behind on this process. Sadly, I was unsuccessful in the transference of our illustrations to the LED matrix with the remaining two hours of the day. We will try again tomorrow. Additionally, Wendy initiated a collection of bottle caps and can tabs today. Soon becoming a habit, we carried out our daily stand-up at the start of the day and made plans for the next day towards the end.
              <h5>+ GUEST LECTURE ON ROBOTS.</h5>
              The guest lecture was 
              <b><a class="words" href="http://www.joostbroekens.com/" target="_blank">Joost Broekens</a></b> (Phd) who is an assistant professor of Affective Computing at Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) of Leiden University, as well as a co-founder and CTO of 
              <b><a class="words" href="https://www.interactive-robotics.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Robotics</a></b>. Whilst his lecture was rather dry, he was incredibly knowledgeable about the field of robotics.

              <h5>MAKING SHIT WORK. SERVO MOTORS AND FACE DETECTION COMBINATION MADE A SUCCESS. ARDUINO TO RGB LED MATRIX MADE A SUCCESS. BUYING MATERIALS TO BUILD THE STRUCTURE. <br>THURSDAY. 6 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              Today was a day of successes. We made the pan-tilt servo motors work with face detecting as well as found a way to program our illustrations onto the LED matrix. More specifically, Patrick did and he was a life-saver! Finally! It was a tough and long process but the results were satisfying. Plus, we made a list of materials needed yesterday and added to it today. Next, we went to purchase the materials we could not salvage elsewhere. Last but not least, we were selected to present what we have so far at the end of the day. It was essentially our pan-tilt servo motors working in tune with the face detection program. <br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day4.png" alt="">

              <br><br>An increasing present issue that arise after the first day was that the Dutch students were gradually switching more and more to conversing in Dutch. While I do and can continue reminding them, it is an exclusive behaviour not going hand in hand with group collaboration. This is especially so when discussing in pairs (using Dutch) and settling on a decision without the consensus of others. This was frustratingly not ideal for group cooperation. Additionally, I have noted that when someone is not present (for tests, interviews and personal matters), they do not matter and are not kept appraised. This, for me, spells a serious lack of communication.
              <h5>+ GUEST LECTURE ON COMMUNICATION PURPOSES.</h5>
              The guest lecture was Teun Verkerk and he talked about technology used for communication purposes, specifically in the field of architecture. To be honest, this topic kind of went over my head as the idea of 
              <b><a class="words" href="http://www.robotinresidence.com/" target="_blank">Robot in Residence</a></b> &mdash; introducing robotics to the construction industry did not appeal to me.

              <br><br><br><h1>5</h1><br>
              <h5>MAKING A PROMISE. CONSTRUCTION OF STRUCTURE FOR THE POT AND HEAD. TRANSFER ALL EMOTIONS WITH COLOUR INTO DISPLAY. UPGRADE FACE DETECTION TO A MORE RELIABLE (CLOSEST) SMILE DETECTION. UPDATE SCRUM BOARD. <br>FRIDAY. 7 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              First things first, we made a proposition for our product that “we promise you recycling can be fun”. We started construction of the structure of our intended product. I would not have went with clay as the material of choice but this was one of the decisions made that I was not privy to. As such, it was especially important to get started on the clay for the pot today so that it can set over the weekend. We underestimated the amount of clay packets needed. We bought 10 and had to make another run to action for another 10. We agreed to go with paper mache over a balloon for the head because we are striving for lightweight. Larissa, Wendy and Patrick worked on the clay pot while I undertook the construction of the paper mache head.<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day5.png" alt="">

              <br><br>Subsequently, the LED matrix needs to be fine-tuned to include the codes for all the emotions mapped out with their accompanying colours plus different frames for each to create a mini animation. Next, we wanted to link the change in emotions to face detection movement. For the happy emotion, we decided to use someone’s smile to make it appear. So now, we have to upgrade the face detection program to a smile detection one which Hernan is working on
              <h5>+ GUEST LECTURE ON PLAYFUL INTERFACES.</h5>
              The guest lecture was 
              <b><a class="words" href="http://maro.dandyunicorns.com/" target="_blank">Marcello Gómez Maureira</a></b>. He is half of the magical duo Dandy Unicorns, working alongside Isabelle Kniestedt. His lecture was entertaining. I am not per se a video games or gamification person but he has me sold. Upon looking into 
              <b><a class="words" href="http://www.dandyunicorns.com/" target="_blank">Dandy Unicorns</a></b>, I am awe-spired by how they seamlessly combined coding, games and graphic design. I would like to do something like this in the future &mdash;taking a few of my interests and making it work.

              <h5>FIX THE POT OF CRACKED CLAY. FIX THE PAPER MACHE HEAD. PONDER ON THE NECESSITY OF AN ACCOMPANYING POSTER. ADD THE STORAGE BIN AND STEM TO THE POT. <br>TUESDAY. 11 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              Today was a hands-on day. When we first arrived, we realized the clay was cracked in multiple spots and the paper mache was bumpy and uneven. Everyone was unsure about how to counter these cracks or what was the best solution. I saw this as an opportunity and suggested the use of plaster. My reasoning is because plaster is low in cost, easy to apply and has fast drying / settling alternatives (which is crucial to take into account with our time crunch). They agreed and I made a run to Gamma to purchase the necessary supplies &mdash; a 2,5kilos of ‘snelgips’, a 5L bucket and an application tool. The plaster turned out to be a great patching material and was extremely fast drying but we once again underestimated the amount needed and Wendy and Larissa had to make a return trip to Gamma to get another 2 packets. In the meantime, I was trying to fix the groovy paper mache head. I first tried putting a few more layers on the balloon while Patrick blow-dried it. However, it did not help and was coming off at the edges. This is indicative of using a mixture that is too diluted. As we were out of white glue and I did not want to make impulsive or unnecessary purchases, I chatted up someone from another group who was also doing paper mache to enquire on their process and how it was going. I politely asked her if I could try using their solution instead, which was a mixture like that which is used for applying wallpaper. She was agreeable and happy to help as they had a whole bucket of it and its supply largely supersedes their demand for it. I was incredibly thankful as I needed to fix my head which it did. The need for an accompanying poster, to make the installation self-sufficient, is briefly discussed. <br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day6.png" alt="">

              <br><br>At the end of the day, Chris mentions that they will be collecting requirements the next day so there will be a consistent, plaque-like description corresponding to each and every installation present on the day. A fixed set of instructions to us will be given first thing tomorrow.

              <h5>MAKE SOME PROGRESS WITH PROGRAMMING ITS FUNCTIONALITY. HAVE ITS PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES MOSTLY SOLIDIFY. DECIDE ON A GROUP NAME AND A PRODUCT NAME. DECIDE ON REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR INSTALLATION AT THE EXPO. REVIEW SCRUM BOARD. <br>WEDNESDAY. 12 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              I was charged with filling in the form in the morning. We had to decide our group and product name before lunch. I chose to bring in a little democracy with the method for doing so. This also makes decision-making more efficient and allows for everyone to have a say. Our group name is Pixel Leaf and our product name is Nom Nom. Patrikas had the winning group name and I came up with the preferred product name. This was decided through dotvoting where Larissa’s vote was omitted due to her absence. Plus, we submitted our requirements for the installation at the EXPO this Friday. The most exciting progress / development of today is the success in linking the smile detection programme with the LED matrix. Kudos Hernan! Essentially, the program first detects a face and lingers trying to detect a smile. When that happens, its neutral face changes to a happy face. When it does not detect a smile after a period of time, it changes to a sad emotion. The concept is when Nom Nom is happy, it opens its jaw, allowing users to throw bottle caps and can tabs into its mouth which will be recycled. Why this? Because existing recycling bins are no different than regular bins. Hence, we wanted to give it some personality.

              <br><br>First thing in the morning, the pot structure was sandpapered to remove any jagged edges as well as to prep for the application of a coat of paint. In the afternoon, we attached the stem to the plate cover (for hiding its collection and wiring). Additionally, we needed to solidify the skeleton of Nom Nom, especially its head so we can better test the programming functionality. The heavy rain all day is not ideal / productive for sourcing out more supplies. We had to get more servos, the head structure (Patrick wants to go with metal netted domes as he felt that it would be easily to install the servos to), paint for the pot as well as paint for the head. I felt that the netted structure intended for use in constructing its head is not practical for paint alone to go on it. The others thought that we could find a solution after we have gotten the supplies. Towards the end of the day, I was tasked with creating a poster which I did not think was necessary anymore as it would be a repetition to that which would be provided to us by the teaching staff. Hence, I suggested I could make an instructions label instead.

              In the morning, the boys went to Gamma searching for long wires. However, they did not have the ones we needed. As such, the four of them left in a panic to go purchase long wires from Kiwi Electronics and returned after lunch with only three rolls. Whilst they were gone, I cut some wires and trimmed the edges (as we only had chicken wire) and used it to secure the head. It was wobbly and I manage to make it such that it needed considerable force to shift. <br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/process/day8.png" alt="">

              <br><br>Animations for the emotions were scraped due to time limitations and the opening of its jaw was not possible as the servos we had were incapable of lifting what we thought to be light. It happens and we misjudged the probability of doing so. In hindsight, we should have researched or tested the weight load the servos can carry although we did not have the structure of the head ready. When they returned, I trimmed the rolls of wire into strips of 1.5meters long. We had to solder 16 wires to connect the computer to the arduino, servos and LED matrix. Patrick was struggling as he had incredibly shaky hands. I offered to do the soldering as I make a hobby out of tiffany glass art which involves soldering. Sure, it was with lead and glass but I am familiar with the technique and my hands are perfectly steady from a lifetime of drawing. I could have incredibly sped up the process but he felt that Larissa should have a go. I spent the rest of my day ammending the instruction label to suit the omissions and finalized it in the night.

              <h5>SOLDERING. FURTHER OMISSION OF LED MATRIX. SETTING UP STRUCTURE FOR THE EXPO. HCI EXPO. <br>FRIDAY. 14 JUNE 2019.</h5>
              In the morning, they continued with soldering while I went out on a run to make two copies of the instructions. Upon returning, I found out that the LED matrix is taken out because it was once again too heavy for the head and we did not have enough long wires. I suggested placing the LED matrix on the base on the stem (right next to the laptop) as the eyes need not be located at the anatomically correct position. However, Larissa unanimously insisted that long wires are still needed. I just felt it was a shame that Hernan's hardwork with linking the programs up was scraped but I suppose it is all part of the process. <br><br>

              <br><br><b>HCI Expo from 16:00 to 20:00.</b> Welcome talk by Chris was at 17:00. The expo actually went better than I anticipated, considering all the facets we had to omit in the end. Additionally, I was pleasantly content that it had endured through the four-hour EXPO. At the end of the day, I was exhausted to no end so I was relieved it was over but happy it happened.<br><br>

              <p class="mb-5">This is a showcase of the look and functionality of our final product presented at the EXPO. It also touches on the intermediate products and subsidiary functionalities leading up to this. A 
              <b><a class="words portfolio-item" href="#portfolio-modal-4">process</a></b> was taken to eventually get to this product and a more evaluative 
              <b><a class="words portfolio-item" href="#portfolio-modal-6">reflection</a></b> of the product, with its contributing factors, is also complementary to the product itself.

              <br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212; 
              <h5>THE PRODUCT PRESENTED AT THE EXPO</h5>
              Our product, which we named as Nom-Nom, is intended to facilitate recycling. NOM NOM is a smart recycling bin. It has the appearance of a plant in order to remind users about how important recycling is for our environment. The system we have developed strives to motivate users to interact with it through displaying emotions on a LED matrix. The plant detects the nearest person and follows it with its head in an effort to seek attention. If you contain your smile, she expresses her disappointment through her eyes. If you smile, the plant smiles back with its eyes and open its jaw. Once the jaw is open, users are able to throw bottle caps and can tabs into its mouth for recycling. After a pre-determined time, she will close her mouth once again and the idea carries on. While we had all the parts to bring this to fruition, our head structure and lack of long wires resulted in multiple omissions.<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/product/product.png" alt="">

              <br><br>Unfortunately, what we were able to bring forth during the EXPO was Nom-Nom who still follows a face she detects but without her expressive eyes and always having her mouth ajar for bottle caps and can tabs to be thrown in as well as a collection tray located in her pot.<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/product/product2.gif" alt="">

              <br><br>While we were elated that our product proved sturdy and durable by lasting through the 4-hour long EXPO with minimal implications to its structure and functionality, there were complications with the program when there were too many people in its eyeline. This reflects on our face detection program but also with the presentation and layout of our installation. Plus, through a reoccurance with a number of presentations to visitors, I realized that users liked seeing what Nom-Nom sees and the throwing aspect should not be neglected. A speculation with the second preference is that people probably liked tactile qualities, active participation or the idea of being in control of something.<br><br><br>

              <h5>INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS</h5>
              First intermediate product we created was emotions illustrated on a pixel grid. From this, we found out that black could not be effectively used as a colour because that would just mean the LED is switched off. So, designs should preferably contain no black outlines. Subsequently, we made animated illustrations to test its possibility. We wanted to try this out as movement attracts attention and draws one's eyes. Additionally, it would make Nom-Nom look and feel more alive. We then created emotions projected onto the RGB LED 16 by 32 matrix. We put colour and animations on hold to prioritize smoothing out technical link between (closest) smile detection and emotions.<br><br>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/labweeks/product/product3.gif" alt="">

              <br><br>In terms of structural in-betweens, we made a paper mache over a balloon for the head, which then got replaced by two semi-sphere metal netted covers. Additionally, we intended to using a two-tier desk organizer within the pot for the collection tray and for hiding the hardware. However, due to the slight alteration of form when the clay formed, we improvised retaining the existing frame placed vertically and only keeping one tray for the collection.<br><br>

              <h5>POSSIBLE VALUE AND RELEVANCE OF THE PRODUCT</h5>
              Aesthetically, this beats any regular old recycling bin. It subtly engages the user to recycle. This is of value as recycling is becoming a pressing concern for society. Plus, an end user would need a collection point for their recyclables. As such, we incorporated a collection tray to depict how the pot can be used for storage. This product is relevant as a basis for an alternative recycling bin. It can be refined and developed to lower production costs or provide more interactions.<br><br><br>

              <p class="mb-5">Here is my reflection of the entirety of the 
              <b><a class="words portfolio-item" href="#portfolio-modal-4">process</a></b> (group and experience-wise) as well as the various facets surrounding the 
              <b><a class="words portfolio-item" href="#portfolio-modal-5">product</a></b>. As this is a reflection, the views expressed by me may not be universal but are well-founded in my experience through the 9 days of Lab Weeks.

              <br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212; 
              <h5>THE PRODUCT</h5>
              With regards to the product itself, I was content with it for the first few days. When I saw that we have not achieved any intermediary products / checkpoints, I was worried about our concepts' feasilbility. However, everyone else seemed determined on this one track path and I left it be. I should have pushed harder. Additionally, I felt that the technological aspect and the design + building of the product were kept separated, which was not ideal for the viability of the product. I found that this arose due to a lack of communication and democracy (involving everyone in decision-making), resulting in costs incurred that were on the high side. As a whole, I was fond of the overall concept but I just discerned that its execution could have been refined as it was a tremendous shame that a multitude of aspects contributing to our concept did not come together in the final product. The intermediate technologies made to work were remarkably satisfying! However, as previously mentioned, it should have went hand in hand and worked closely with a mastermind of the construction of form.<br><br>
              Personally, recycling would not have been my first choice but it is an ever-growing pressing issue and as such, a worthy cause to tackle. Plus, I felt that we had sufficiently addressed how our product would support recycling in theory. On the contrary, I observed that the fun aspect, as spelled out in our promise, was not delivered to fruition. I gathered that this is due to our concept barely evolving as we went along. We started with wanting to create something spunky as well as feisty and did not adapt it to the new playfulness we wish to incorporate and achieve. On the structural front, we did not pay close enough attention to the head and what it required to make it open and close. Plus, the weight load our head could support should have been tested earlier as it was the factor that forced us into numerous omissions. Last but not least, the connection between head to stem could have been better executed.<br><br>
              All in all, our product did withstand four hours of usage with minimal complications to its structure and functionality. So, I am incredibly proud of its sturdiness and durability. With regards to the technology used though, it had to be reloaded every so often to prevent hiccups. At some point during the EXPO, there was poor planning when the laptop slept and as I was not the owner, I could not unlock it. Also, it gets easily confused when there are multiple people in its eyeline. which reflects more on the setup we had. We should have barred it better so it is more exclusive. More on the nitty-gritty side of things, the can tabs and bottle caps were mostly neglected as it is not visible but rather, placed by the wall, to a side and on the floor (out of view, out of mind). As such we could have definitely put in more thought into the presentation and the layout of our installation (placements and all), which was not done owing to poor time management. However, the genuine response and interest shown by visitors and schoolmates during the EXPO did make me consider if I am too harsh on my judgement of our product.<br><br><br>

              <h5>THE GROUP</h5>
              On the group collaboration front, I noted that all of us were mostly passive and no one stepped up to the leadership mantle. There were no distinct roles or task allocation (everyone is just doing whatever they please) as time went by. Plus, tasks were not assigned based on strengths which could definitely have improved our speed and efficiency. Group cooperation wise, there were prominent issues with the language barrier and self justified decisions as mentioned in the process. There was a clear lack of communication, which was progressively notable and a deterrence to the effectiveness of the team. Numerous sole or duo decision-making moments resulted in a subpar ability to build of the ideas of others, which was the beauty of group creation. While I did cherish the creation aspect of this process, I wished I could have some input in programming as I wish to grow in that skill. I offered but was declined by our programmer and I respected his expertise. In hindsight, I should not have undermine my own capabilities and insisted more. Even though spontaneity can be promising in provoking creativity, I found the level of spontaneity to be too high. The constant "do first, think later" mentality of each individual was not kind to our pockets or time crunch. In the second week, there was little to no forward thinking. Discussion and planning became non-existent, which is counter-productive to our diminishing time constrain. Finally, what I found most baffling is the unwillingness to share resources. It made me feel like a pariah and unwanted at times. For instance, I offered and repeated myself thrice in our group whatsapp, and once individually, about the group video and how I was willing to comply the video clips we all made. I was ignored and did not get a single response or a single picture or video from anyone. Being made to feel invisible was extraordinarily depressing and while I know that I should retain my work ethics and push through, I admit that, in all honesty, it negatively affected the effort I put into complying my own pictures and videos.<br><br><br>

              <h5>THE EXPERIENCE</h5>
              <b>LAB WEEKS:</b> On top of the intensive process, back to back days and long hours, the 3-hour per day travelling time and accompanying hefty costs were truly weighing me down with each passing day. It might have been reflected on my enthusiasm levels over time but I did not let it affect the quantity and quality of my work. While I am sufficiently equipped in group cooperation, I discerned that I still have much to work on when it comes to group collaboration. On my personal development with group work, I perceived that I desperately need to learn how to be heard by possibly being more assertive. Developing my people skills (being likeable) could be beneficial to the aforementioned. However, I am aware that this cannot realistically be improved overnight but should definitely be worked on diligently from now on. The process was nail-biting and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was an experience worth cherishing. Plus, to briefly check in on the processes of other groups was also an intriguing experience to behold. On the other hand, I identified that there was a disparity between working conventions as I was taught to be willing to change course whenever necessary ("do not get too attached to your first ideas" mentality) while I noted that the others in my group were determined to have a one-path process and mould it to succession. It was an unorthodox approach for me but I admire the determination. In summary, I enjoyed the experience and it taught me to have more confidence in myself as well as others and be less critical. Creation can and should be fun!<br><br>

              <b>EXPO:</b> The EXPO was indeed an exciting and crazy experience to have. Taking the time to look at what everyone achieved was enlightening. What I personally noticed is the installations that stuck in my mind tend to be the simplest of concepts that were developed and grown upon through the days. Examples include Packzy, FeedMe, Lemon Maze and You &#x26; Eye, to name a few. By presenting at the EXPO, I also got a better grasp at the inner workings of presentations &mdash; how to draw visitors in as well as how to retain their attention by being more engaging in pitching the concept. The EXPO also presented an opportunity to present to a larger number of audience than I am accustomed to. This first-hand encounter reinforces in me, the need for user testing because of all the valuable insights I received and gathered. First and foremost, I was thinking mostly in the technical aspect but visitors were drawn in by the aesthetics and were much easily impressed with the technology than I expected. Plus, the reviews were motivating and way better than I anticipated. I was expecting the worse, to say the least. On top of all this, I observed, through a number of presentations I gave, that users liked seeing what Nom-Nom sees and the throwing aspect should not be neglected. Even though the throwing of bottle caps was not as elaborate as we envisioned, the audience enjoyed the interactivity anyway. Through the proceedings of the EXPO, my biggest takeaway is that through hardwork and preserverance, we can build unbelievably awesome products in just 9 days because all of us (hundred-plus of us) did so!<br><br>

              <b>WERE EXPECTATIONS MET?</b>
              While I was doubtful of its necessity at the start, the location was a good call for this purpose (away from school + own spot). Maakhaven was home for 9 days and created the mentality of free minds (encourages idea generation), productive tinkering and a can-do spirit. However, in terms of my pre-conceived expectations, I am a tad disappointed that I did not really touched any programming (except for about an hour looking into the LED matrix) as I anticipated the chance to further practise and improve my programming capabilities. I imagine I could have if I had insisted with more fervour but was hesitant as I did not want to step on any toes. Regardless, I also expected this course of activities to be different and challenging and it did held up on that end of the bargain. The extent of the lab weeks has indeed instilled a sense of accomplishment, ownership and satisfaction + renewed confidence that comes with it. I absolutely enjoyed the conceptualization and its creation. In the end, I was proud of what we achieved. I most certainly would not have imagined I was capable of accomplishing all this if you had asked me two weeks before. Who knows what I can create two years from now? <br><br>
