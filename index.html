              <p class="mb-5">Creativity is a crucial ingredient of design. It involves exploring what creativity means for the design process and how I can use creativity in this process. Since visualizing ideas, concepts and messages is an important skill to enhance creativity and to cooperate with others in design processes, this focuses on developing visualizing skills. There are 20 assignments, including the design of a representational cover and a logo, to be made on A3 paper (not digitally) and bundled in a portfolio.

              <p class="mb-5"> This course focuses on programming for the interactive web. It aims to teach knowledge and understanding of the logic and structure required in programming for the web.
              The approach to programming in the UXD-program is that programming is an essential skill during each part of the design process. It is used along side other techniques, to stimulate creativity, validate design solutions and communicate resulting products. Therefore, the program focuses on creating programmed sketches, proof of concepts and prototypes respectively.

              <div id="heading"><b>ASSIGNMENT 1</b></div><br>

              The assignment is to design and create a website that is to be used inside the spacecraft. The purpose of the website is to give information about the trip and to prepare travellers for upcoming arrival on mars. Factors can include ship controls, ship environment, supplies or anything else but these travellers should be able to use the interface anywhere on the ship. My inspiration is the movie, ‘Passengers’.
              Hence, the first things that came to mind was a list of activities, food and drinks.
              However, I realized that if I were a passenger on this voyage, there are a few updates I would need to know that takes precedence over those stated above. Namely, the current date, time and distance to the destination (it takes 6 to 8 months!) and perhaps, some outlet to voice my concerns.
              Plus, I feel that paying $200,000 for a ticket deems a classier and polite tone. With this and the factors in mind, I made a rough HTML and CSS to see what I can work with. I tried to play the DOM by calling IDs which got me carried away giving IDs to everything. When I got to the countdown, I thought how annoying it would be to keep having to look at the long remaining time. Hence, I felt like this is a good extra opportunity to work with timers.
              By looking up forms, I found an option of putting a field as ‘required’ but did not manage to find a way the forms can possibly be sent by email. Also, I wanted to make a list of activities that can be checked or cancelled off like ‘take a swim’, etc. However, I was unsure of how to create an overlay or modal boxes. <br><br>

              <div id="heading"><b>ASSIGNMENT 2</b></div><br>

              The second assignment is to design and create a large animated Space Clock to be projected onto the dome which would serve as a central timepiece. The style and theme is open but actual time and date should be shown in an interesting way.
              I started off with a flip clock in mind as they always amuse me and I could watch it for minutes. However, examples I found were either done using jQuery or FlipClock.js and I decided it was too difficult. Hence, I began with an analog clock with the aid of the tutorial whilst adding my own spin. I got engrossed in SVGs. The same instructor had two interesting videos on them. With the aid of ‘Learning SVG’ and a browse of ‘Creating Web Icons with SVG’ by Morten RandHendriksen, I made my own SVG and added the date on top of it. I really wished SVG was taught in the lectures though.
              As I had an extra week to work on this, I tried making a simpler flip clock without gradients or shadows. Also, GreenSock platform had examples. In one called ‘GreenSock Homepage Animation’ they rotated a square box 180degrees which gives the same look. In the end, it was my two separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript that proved tricky to merge. Things kept going missing. Additionally, I really should have stuck with my plan for the analog clock as I would love to have seen that in actualization. I wanted the inner shadow and an external long shadow to rotate along with the hour arm between 10am-10pm. Outside of those times, the inner face would be grey and there would not be a long shadow.<br><br>

              The third and last assignment is about 32 colonists are returning to their home planet, Earth, from mars. We were to design and create a means to find the perfect landing spot on here on the Earth surface. There are many factors to take into account when landing on our surface.
              I decided to incorporate clouds or general weather conditions, previews of potential landing spots as images and marking possible landing areas on the map. I started off by mapping where I want my map. Firstly, I aimed to keep the page as a one-page dashboard (without scrolling). Hence, I decided the map should only take up half the width. Google maps are able to zoom in and open in full screen anyway. Next step was making the Google Maps API to work.
              Whilst I like playing with styles, the style of the night mode was beautiful so I incorporated some of the colours from it to the rest of my page. However, the colour of the water was a sight of sore eye. Thus, I made it black. As I am assuming home is England or its thereabouts, I did not want the open Weather API to take any input. I decided to set my own instead. Rather than seeing them all at the time, I made it such that you only display the current weather when clicked on. Plus, it disappears after 10 seconds (I cannot get enough of this).
              The last thing I did was the information windows. They were trickier than I thought they would be. I ended up having a very messy content line as the content of the information window has to be placed in JavaScript and that is very strange to me.<br><br>

							<p class="mb-5">Personally, I am a user of the '9292' application on a daily basis. Hence, I decided to use this application as a base whilst changing the aspects that could be improved. I kept the general layout of the landing page as the framing of the fields makes it stand out at first glance. However, I wanted to make the extra options more obvious by including a big plus sign in the middle. Afterwhich, I added options that can be checked or unchecked like 'fastest duration' and 'transfer times' in order to fit the requirements. <br>
              Subsequently, I was pondering the scrolling method to select a date and time if the default now is not desirable. I considered using a calendar instead for the choosing of dates. Lastly, the detailed page of the routes available is something that really bothers me. Thus, I tried to capture it in a timeline setting to better show to process needed. On the other hand, I do not think my detailed page has enough information available and I am trying to avoid any need to scroll as it hinders checking on the go.

							<p class="mb-5">First of all, I realized I was missing two 'Must-haves' requirements upon checking back on my first draft of wireframes. I did not incorporate bicycles as a mode of transportation and did not fathom the need for a 'search' button. (As I do not have labels) The five means of transportations I included were buses, trams, metro, train and ferry. So, I really want to amend this in some way on top of the expert review.
							<br><br>
							The main changes I made in this revision is he incorporation of cycling instead of walking. Other changes made are that I included 'most recent' in the choosing of locations and got rid of the kilometers in the detailed page. Based on the expert review, I am still not too sure if I should get rid of the bottom menu. Therefore, I went looking for other possible redundant content and did not think it is practical for kilometers of the journey which could possibly make room for the total pricing of the journeys.
							<br><br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212; <br><br>
							<b>REFLECTIVE CONCLUSION:</b> <br>
							With wireframes, I feel that I really do not have a habit of labelling. I kept ending up 'labelling' in my mind and completely forgetting about it once again. I think with wireframing, it is better to start with a hand-drawn version first before jumping into digital tools so that I have a reference to work off of.
              I found the challenge here to be forfeiting the use of colour and graphics. Without them, I felt less driven. Also, I tried using 'sketch' and it was frustrating. I use 'illustrator' very often and am constantly using its shorthands: most of which are useless in 'sketch'. The one that really got on my nerves was 'V' which is for changing to the selection tool in 'illustrator' and 'photoshop'. Sketch has 'V' as a pen tool!

              <div id="heading"><b>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</b></div><br>

              This is a continuation of the journey planning application from Assignment 2.1. An interactive high-fidelity prototype of a public transportation journey planner application will be built based on those wireframes. The wireframes should already define the content, layouts, navigation, and interactive elements the design will have.
              The difference is for high-fidelity is that the application needs to have the look and feel of a “final” product. 


              In this functional high fidelity digital prototypes, the non-functional requirement relating to visual identity of the company should now also be fulfiled.

              <ul>
                <li><b>(M) The interface shall conform to the visual identity of the company.</b></li>
                <li>The company logo is related to the company’s core values: moving quickly, respecting the environment (green color), keeping the customer satisfied (blue), being courageous and progressive (orange). The font is Arial Rounded MT Bold.</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="mb-5"> <br><br> I jumped at the chance to be reunited with colours again and was boldly set on incorporating the three colours of the company. I started with blue as it is the most calming and pleasing to the user, of the three, in huge doses. However, the blue used is on the light side so I matched it with black to make it stand out. Orange, as a complementary colour of blue, was used for interactive elements. Green was used to show the text field the user is currently in as well as end goals. In the end, I think pages that had both green and orange in them were too distracting.

              <p class="mb-5">First and foremost, reviewing the expert review I received showed me that I could also use it myself as a checklist for future works. Additionally, I definitely should have done more pages. There needed to be a few pages to show the other functions in the menu and some to show how I intended to incorporate the map (modal box). Providing feedback, offering help and usage of emotions were most lacking. I could have added the 'jaws' tune or something similar in suspense when the user chooses the earliest option. It is surprising how quickly I neglect the use of sounds. Also, the "run, run" pop up idea seems engaging.
              <br><br>
              Going more into the expert review's suggestions for improvement, it mentions that a dropdown menu is not efficient but the previous expert review on my wireframes mentioned that the bottom menu was unneccessary content. Ergo, I am uncertain about what is the best way to approach this otherwise.

              <b>REFLECTIVE CONCLUSION:</b> <br>
              With hi-fi paper prototyping, I feel that the main factor working against it is how time-consuming it is to make one. However, it is much more effective in using testing as the interactions are clearly presented in a clickable prototype. For this assignment, I tried using Adobe XD for the first time. As it turns out, I absolutely love it! It is easy to use and simple to prototype with but it has a limited choice of transitions as compared to the tools I have tried : invision and marvelapp. I found the amount of detail and thought that needs to go into a high-fidelity prototype to be the most challenging and intriguing.

							<p>What is this foreign term, 'Exploratory Prototyping'? Proof-of-Principle prototype and research prototype are other terms associated with this. It explores some functional, but not all, aspects of the intended design, helps explore interaction design theory and practice and is not necessarily aimed towards a final product. Its purpose is to explore feasibility, prove theory, reaffirm previous results or to investigate research or product development direction.

              <br>Our assignment is to carry out an A/B Testing. This involves:

              <ul>
                <li>Two (or more) variants: Prototype A and Prototype B;</li>

              <p class="mb-5"> <br><br> I feel that there is so much to investigate with menus like what colours are better, boxed or underlined tabs, shapes of the tabs, placement of the menus (dropdown, top menu or side menu), etc. <br>Hence, I decided to start with my basic curiosity of if there is ever too much tabs.

              <br><br><br>&#8212; &#9733; &#8212; <br><br>
              <b>THE TESTING:</b>

              <p class="mb-5">To summarize my findings, five out of six participants with prototype A looked through all three tabs at least once. four out of six particpants with prototype B looked through all six tabs at least once. The average time the webshop with three tabs engaged its participants is 40.7 seconds. The average time the webshop with six tabs engaged its participants is 38.3 seconds. Three out of the six participants for both tests looked through the tabs more than once.
              <br><br>
              The results were not as I expected. I anticipated that most participants would not look through all six tabs in prototype B. Two thirds of them did. Additionally, I predicted that prototype A would hold their attention more. However, only a three seconds difference does not seem like much. This might be set back due to the pages not changing across the tabs. Interestingly, it differs in the amount of times a tab is open. Two participants using prototype A looked at all three tabs more than once. None of the participants using prototype B looked at all six tabs more than once. The most amount of tabs visited a second time was four. Another surprising insight from this testing that I only noticed through the screen recordings is that those with prototype A clicked more, by nearly double, than those with prototype B.

              <b>REFLECTIVE CONCLUSION:</b> <br>
              This investigative take on prototyping is exhilarating. I felt like Sherlock Holmes although it was a little disappointing when the results did not prove my hypothesis. For this assignment, I worked on illustration for the design and did the prototype on the marvelapp. With exploratory prototyping, I find it really difficult to minimize its limitations. There appears to be so many factors that might affect the results, the more thought is given. For instance, would the results had been entirely differentif I had tested it on more females instead of males. How can we eradicate these variables completely?

              <p class="mb-5">The assignment here is to build a Wizard of Oz prototype, an experience prototype. The prototypes stimulates social interaction, uses body movement as input and projects (interactive) images or animations onto a floor. For making this Wizard of Oz prototype, we can choose to work with (almost) any kind of software. We have to try to be creative and think of ways to interact with animations and/or images. Tools that could work include Scratch, Powerpoint, Processing and many others.
              The objective is to try to be creative with what we know and are comfortable working with.

              <li> does not have to focus on balancing; </li>
              <li> use body movement as ‘input’; </li>
              <li> stimulate social interaction (allowing players/users to cooperate or play together); </li>

              <b>THE CONCEPT:</b></p>

              <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="img/portfolio/assignment4/wizardofoz.png" alt="">

              <p class="mb-5"> <br><br> We drew our inspiration from 'dance dance revolution'. As the prototype would be projected, we decided to incorporate movements in the form of jumping on clouds to make it more realistic. To elaborate, once the game has begun and the user does not see a cloud under his feet, he has fallen. We decided to go with Powerpoint slides as we are both comfortable with it and were keen on finding out how to make the transitions work between success slides and failure slides.

              <br><br><br>&#8212; &#9733; &#8212; <br><br>
              <b>THE TESTING:</b>
              </p>

              <video class="img-fluid mb-5" controls>

              </video>

              <p class="mb-5"> <br><br> During the testing phase, we had loads to reflect on. Firstly, we placed our instructions in the game itself. No one else did so and explained it verbally instead. Secondly, our game play is much too short as seen in the video above. Lastly, we were unable to factor in the different outcomes: win or lose.

              <br><br><br>&#8212; &#9733; &#8212; <br><br>
              <b>THE SECOND PROTOTYPE:</b>
              </p>

              <iframe src='https://dehaagsehogeschool-my.sharepoint.com/personal/16121430_student_hhs_nl/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc={41db928a-e8ce-45ed-9ea6-0b93006172bf}&action=embedview&wdAr=0.75' width='600px' height='572px' frameborder='0'>Dit is een ingesloten <a target='_blank' href='https://office.com'>Microsoft Office</a>-presentatiebestand dat mogelijk is gemaakt door <a target='_blank' href='https://office.com/webapps'>Office Online</a>.</iframe>

              <p class="mb-5"> <br><br> Due to the incredibly disappointing gameplay and feedback, we had to make another prototype. We decided to keep the instructions in the game as it makes it self-explanatory and builds anticipation for the start. We added enough rounds this time for the speed of the cloud to increase (and realised we needed to time over slide transitions). Additionally, we solved the problem of the two possible outcomes: winning and losing. We put the 'game over' slide at the very end of the powerpoint. This way, all the wizard has to do when the user falls is the key in "the number of slides in the presentation + Enter". Also, instead of just ending the gameplay with no feedback to the user, we added a slide to explain the completion of the existing prototype. Last but not least, upon reflecting on the project scopes, we realized we did not stimulate social interaction (allowing players/users to cooperate or play together). Below is a possibility of doing so such that two players can participate and would have to navigate around each other, making it harder. This would mean that there would be a maximum of twelve clouds in total at any single time in the game instead of the original six.<br><br><br>

              <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="img/portfolio/assignment4/improvement.png" alt="">

              <br><br><br>&#8212; &#9733; &#8212; <br><br>
              <b>REFLECTIVE CONCLUSION:</b> <br>
              With experience prototyping, it is more user centered. For instance, we had to think about how to convey instructions to the user and how much time is needed for each sentence of the instructions. However, this method of prototyping is the most engaging. Engagement factors are most in play here. Not only do the prototypes need to function, they also need to be activating and nail-biting.
