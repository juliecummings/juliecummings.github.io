        <p class="text-center"> Wearable technology (in 2019) can include &mdash; but are not limited to &mdash; eyewear, smart textiles, smart key chains, smart tattoos, lifestyle devices, medical devices and other wearables. Designer and author of <i>The Best Interface is No Interface</i>, Golden Krishna, mentions that "our love affair with the digital interface is getting out of hand". In hopes to step away from the abundance of interfaces / screens, could wearables perhaps serve as a solution? After all, wearables are getting smaller and are helping us with our health and safety as well as being fashionable. Nevertheless, there is a high likelihood that digital devices will become a part of us in the future. In the words of Elon Musk, "Humans must become cyborgs if they are to stay relevant in the future". <br><br>

        If this interests you, take a look at examples I found in my research, a mini conceptual assignment and my views on the topic. <br><br> </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                Owing largely to the success of wearable fitness and sleep trackers such as Apple Watch, Nike Fuelband and Fitbit, there is a cultural phenomenon of Quantified Self. This is especially embraced in the health industry where â€œself-knowledge through numbers" is most valued by the community. <br> Here are two such applications:

                <h5>HEALTH INDUSTRY:</h5> <h4>THE DERMAL ABYSS</h4>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/wearables/dermalabyss.jpg" alt="">

                For numerous people with diabetes, keeping tabs on blood sugar daily can be costly, time-consuming and invasive. The DermalAbyss project is the result of a collaboration between MIT and Harvard Medical School researchers. They explored a creative new approach that could help make things easier: biosensing tattoos. It blends advances in biotechnology with traditional methods in tattoo artistry. <br><br> They have developed a special tattoo ink that contains cheminals that can sense blood sugar levels, pH, and sodium. For instance, when blood sugar rises, the glucose sensing ink changes from blue to brown as shown below. When a person's salt levels goes up, the sodium sensing ink becomes a more vibrant green under UV light. When alkaline levels tip, a pH sensor changes from purple to pink. <br><br>

                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="img/topics/wearables/dermalabyss1.jpg" alt="">

                DermalAbyss is a proof-of-concept that presents a novel approach to bio-interfaces in which the body surface is rendered an interactive display. However, this is a research project, and there are currently no plans to develop Dermal Abyss as a product or to pursue clinical trials, according to
                <b><a class="words" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/d-Abyss/overview/" target="_blank">their site</a></b>. 
                On the other hand, the 21st annual SXSW Interactive Innovation Awards honored DermalAbyss with the Scifi No Longer Award, given to "the coolest scientific achievement or discovery that before 2017 was only possible in science fiction". <br><br> Watch the following video to learn more about DermalAbyss:<br><br>

                <div class="videos"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/216203028" class="framing" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

                <br>This could potentially be used for medical diagnostics, quantified self and data encoding in the body. This could save diabetic patients from having to constantly prick their fingers to test their blood sugar. This could put the minds of its users at ease. Additionally, as this concept develops, doctors can identify existing issues easily and quickly. I find this interesting as diabetes runs in my family and I have seen first-hand the hassle around it. Hence, I am aware of the difference it can make to those affected.

                <h5>HEALTH INDUSTRY:</h5><h4>KIDDO</h4>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/wearables/kiddo.jpg" alt="">

                Kiddo is a wearable smart band for kids that monitors a childâ€™s health, activity, and sleep levels which it then sends daily insights via the companion app. Kiddo is created under the notion that kids should be allowed to be kids to explore, learn and have fun - even in the age of televisions, gaming consoles and tablets. The Kiddo provides data and insights to back up a parent's instinct - giving a peace of mind that everything is all right and the knowledge that one will be alerted if it is not. There is a multitude of functionalities on the parents' companion application &mdash; some of which are shown below &mdash; that you can read more in 
                <b><a class="words" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kiddowearable/kiddo-stay-connected-to-your-childs-wellbeing?ref=project_link" target="_blank">the campaign</a></b>
                on Kickstarter. Personally, I feel that arming children with such devices is more age-appropriate than phones and tablets.<br><br>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="img/topics/wearables/kiddo1.jpg" alt="">

                Whilst the companion app is relatively detailed and well thought through, I am fascinated with the "kids karaoke" function. Based on motion of the child, it essentially turns the volume up on songs that are projected from the watch through a speaker. It can be further improved with more in-built games on the childrens' end like this karaoke function and possibly even a tracker system which will come in handy on outings (and take away the need for kids to possess mobile phones from a young age). Additionally, even though monitoring of the heart rate, steps, sleep and so on are not novel ideas anymore, it also tracks temperature, perspiration and emotional state. I found that the emotional state aspect , currently based on hourly data, can be further developed. Its applications can eventually even aid the mentally challenged in understanding, anticipating and controlling their mood.

                Video games and wearable technology go well together. As such, some of the very first wearable technology concepts (that are still growing) emerged from gaming. The Power Glove and the Virtual Boy were both 1980s and early 1990s products that predicted Oculus Rift and gesture controlled devices. <br><br>

                <h5>GAMING INDUSTRY:</h5> <h4>KOR-FX HAPTIC FEEDBACK VEST</h4>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/wearables/KOR.jpg" alt="">

                The KOR-FX Haptic feedback vest is about creating the "feel" of being inside a virtual video game, so we can finally know what it feels like to be shot in the chest by an alien blaster. KOR-FX is an innovative vest (when it was introduced) that brings our fragile chests into the world of the video game. KOR-FX is not a rumble pack. Rumble packs use spinning motors to create vibrations. Its acousto-haptic technology uses audio to create precise, directed haptic output with special transducers. This output echoes into our chest cavity and turns our body into an instrument that allows us to feel the environment extremely accurately. As it is essentially an audio device, it works best in games with a lot of loud audio and shines when paired with a virtual reality headset. KOR-FX's initial reveal in June 2014 was promising as shown in the following video. <br><br>

                <div class="videos"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBUduNqQB1M" class="framing" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

                <br> Despite its popularity not catching on, I find this interesting because of the concept behind it. Using sounds to stimulate the senses of touch, proprioception and motion is a promising front. On that note, I feel like KOR-FX was the pioneer of this development. Eventually, this can bring virtual environments to the next level and its applications are not limited to gaming but could also have a great impact on the deaf as NeoSensory is now attempting to implement. It can even eventually enhance the cinematic experience beyond our current 4DX. Possibilities are endless in this department and as such there has been no shortage of ventures in this department. Examples include KOR-FX (2014), Teslasuit (2015), Rapture (2016), NullSpace VR (Hardlight Suit) (2016), AxonVR (2016), bHaptics TactSuit (2017), Woojer (2017) and most recently, NeoSensory exoskin (2018).<br><br>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <p class="mb-5">In the lecture, we talked about how wearables change our communication, our connection  
              with ourselves and influence others in the world around us. Subsequently, we were tasked with an assignment to further ponder over the possible implications and applications of wearables.<br><br>
              <strike><b>CASE 1: NEW WAYS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION</b><br>
              Can you think of an interactive wearable concept that has not been mentioned in the 
              lecture, based on the biometric brainwave data of people who are in the same room as you?</strike><br><br>
              <b>CASE 2: SMART TATTOOS AS A WAY OF COMMUNICATING</b><br>
              Can you think of an interactive wearable concept that has not been mentioned in the 
              lecture, that stimulates social interaction based on smart tattoos?

							<br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212;
							<h5>CONCEPT</h5>
              The concept is to have a smart tattoo that learns about character traits (a few to begin with) over time by monitoring an individual's vitals. The specifics of which I will elaborate when discussing the product.
              <br><br><img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/wearables/doodles.png" alt="">

              <br><br>As the smart tattoo comes to a consensus, it maps itself out on the user's skin. This allows the user to reflect on their dominant traits and if undesired, they can always be worked on and altered through time with consistent changes in interactions. Next, colour coding can be implemented to reflect the user's current mood which can be useful for people having difficulties understanding and/or controlling mood or even for those who yearn to learn how not to let it effect any communication. Last but not least, tattoos could warm up or vibrate slightly when a like-minded (66% likeness or higher) individual is nearby. The similarity value could be set at a higher or lower percentage which will be determined independently, providing further personalization possibilities. If it is paired with an earbud, the alert could even be presented as a thumping sound that speeds up based on proximity. Having this function would stimulate social interaction as people are more inclined to converse with like-minded individuals which in other circumstances, they would otherwise not initiate. Ideally, these smart tattoos are scalable and can be inked on various parts of the body so it can be hidden based on the individual's preference. As a possible add-on for future conceptualization, within a certain proximity, a touch on one person's smart tattoo can be projected / simulated onto another's. This could allow strangers to subtly comfort each other when having a crappy day.<br><br><br>

              <h5>INTERACTION</h5>
              THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY THREE MAIN INTERACTIONS:
              <br><br><img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/wearables/interactions.png" alt="">

              <br><br><b>ONE.</b> developing (changing) top-valued traits through prolonged behaviour (alterations).
              <br><b>TWO.</b> soft vibration or introduction to warmth when in proximity to a 66% (percentage customizable) or higher compatible individual. Additional features could include vibration and/or heat intensifies as distance closes in, accompanying thumping alert that speeds up as space between diminishes (if earbuds are employed) and gesture to halt these notifications (two-finger hold or two-finger double tap).
              <br><b>THREE.</b> colour changes based on real-time mood to aid users in better understanding and control of moods as well as to learn how to interact effectively with others independent of one's mood.
              <br><b>EXTRA.</b> virtual touch through smart tattoos &mdash; tiny nudge for encouragement, poke to engage someone, grasp to offer strong physical contact, stroke for comfort or even morse code for fun.<br><br><br>

              <h5>PRODUCT</h5>
              It starts off as black dots made up of numerous pixel-like components. Vitals such as heart rate, perspiration rate, sleep cycle (and how much is REM sleep), steps taken, and other such information are accumulated. From this data collected over an extended period of time, insights are made such as the wearer is an active and health-conscious person (high step count and moments of high heart rate and perspiration count on a daily basis) or the user is driven to their endeavours (minimal sleep and high heart rate). Wireless earbuds can send data to the smart tattoo like song and/or video choices collected. Plus, as other wearables progress or evolve, they can be in sync with the smart tattoo and it can accumulate even more data. For instance, smart glasses can retain what an individual sees. Once a sufficient period of time has passed and an adequate amount of data has been gathered, the tattoo reveals itself. This is also an ongoing process and susceptible to changes. As such, a variety of ranked character traits will be formulated. Each of these traits will then be given a percentile rank. While these smart tattoos should be as flat as possible and light-weight, the size should optimally be scalable.<br><br>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <p class="mb-5"> It is undeniable that wearables are coming into its own. This is especially so when you look into smartwatches. Numerous brands and startups are developing their own and its functionalities are still being added on to. This trend even supports the ever-growing need to quantify oneself. However, its evolution and hold on society is currently still not widespread. I find that it is due to the mass population needing much more convincing to step away from the screens. This can only happen gradually in time.

              <br><br> Personally, I am not in possession of any wearables. Yet. I am considering but it just does not seem to be a priority for me. I feel that this is owing to the fact that the majority of well-developed wearables available now are targeted in the health, security and gaming sectors, which do not appeal to me.

              <br><br> Regardless, I feel that wearables will have its place in society in the near future. As it gets smaller and smaller in size as well as its costs lowering to enter the mainstream market, wearables will then undeniably have a strong hold on many. This is because wearables are CONVENIENT (compact, portable as well as subtle) while adding value to one's way of life which I consider the most valuable aspect of wearables. For instance, diabetics could do away with the hasslesome pin-pricks and constant worries with a tiny tattoo that could continuously monitor blood sugar level.<br><br>
