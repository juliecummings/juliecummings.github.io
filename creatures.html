        <p class="text-center"> Artificial Creatures is effectively a juxtaposition of itself. "Artificial" insinuating that it learns (thinks) and functions (act) at optimal performance whilst "Creatures" implies that it has needs (thinks) and respond (act) like a living being, possibly even human, based on emotions and/or instinct.<br><br>

        This theme is about looking at current developments in robotics and anticipating what we can expect in the near future. This encompasses systems and devices that can show or recognize emotional / human / animal behaviour &mdash; as if the machines are living beings. Artificial Creatures focuses on how hardware and software can aid in exhibiting behaviour that allows them to offer company to people, for example AIBO, Furby and Paro.<br><br>

        If this interests you, take a look at examples I found in my research, a mini conceptual assignment and my views on the topic. <br><br></p>

                 First and foremost, there are various aspects to consider when finding one that is enthralling. For starts, these are examples that I find have an entrancing movement. They are the 
                 <b><a class="words" href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2018/april/snakebot-rescue-award.html" target="_blank">snakebot</a></b> from Howie Choset and Matt Travers as well as animatronic 
                 <b><a class="words" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/disney-showed-us-the-inner-workings-of-its-avatar-robot-and-its-just-incredible/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_cs=-ibsptNaJUka1bGDJqQTqg" target="_blank">Avatar' shaman</a></b> from Walt Disney Imagineering. <br><br>Below are extracted clips displaying their spellbinding motion.

                Subsequently, there are those that are made to look and move similarly to how human beings or animals would. Prime examples of this is the Atlas and ASIMO. Whilst Atlas is tested outside on loose rock, ice, and so on, Aismo is always in a controlled setting. However, ASIMO appears to be smarter. With animal-like robotics, I am fond of Rongzhong Li's OpenCat even though it is still in its early stages. 
                <b><a class="words" href="https://www.petoi.com/" target="_blank">Petoi</a></b>, a company he founded, aims to design pets for the future. They claim that their friendly pet robots are educational, programable, engaging, and most of all, cute! In my opinion, this is the vision for what would eventually be the ideal companion cats (and maybe even other pets).<br><br>

                Thus far, it is mainly about the realism of its movements or its capabilities with motion. As for interesting developments involving interaction between human beings and machines, I would look at 
                <b><a class="words" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3480644/Meet-Nadine-humanoid-robot-set-PA-care-dementia-patients.html" target="_blank">Nadine</a></b> or 
                <b><a class="words" href="https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/" target="_blank">Sophia</a></b> as they are able to have actual conversations. Nadine is autonomous and can have bounded conversation on its own. She is able to memorize conversations that you had together and use that in context the next time you talk to her. In context, she is also able to express emotion if spoken to rudely. As of now, she could possibly take over receptionists' jobs or aid the elderly and disabled. On the other hand, Sophia is still fairly rudimentary in her ability to think and reason. Her speech and comprehension is powered by Google's singularitynet programme. Despite this, most of her responses have been scripted or generated by a decision tree. At the moment, Sophia is basically a chatbot with a face. All in all, these social robots utilise a perception-decision-action architecture.<br><br>

                Shown above are another two notable mentions for its concepts are the roomba that screams, making it more human, and tiny drones that recognize hand gestures, giving an illusion of ownership and security. The reasoning behind them is intriguing &mdash; how Michael Reeves found it uncharacteristic that a roomba does not react when it bumps into things and how the talkshow host compares it to a human stubbing our toe. The creator of the tiny drones, Marco Tempest, mentions that they know where he is and can follow him around. He does not specifically states it, but it seems like they not only respond to gestures but also audio. Plus, upon further research, Tempest is in the field of magic and I am amused. After looking around, I think that each of the aforementioned (except the roomba that screams) has, to an extent, some value currently but its definitive value can still either soar or depreciate in its respective fields over time based on what society attributes to it.<br><br>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <p class="mb-5">The Homeostasis model was explained in the lecture. This model works by identifying needs. These needs are influenced by own actions or external stimuli. In the lecture, the example was given of the needs of a robot vacuum cleaner (dust, energy and safety) and how this affects its behaviour (consuming detected dust, returning to charge and mapping out environment to avoid collision).

              <br><br>Following this lecture, we were tasked to do a thought experiment by applying a Homeostasis model to a device.
              Selections of said device include <b><strike>a bicycle,</strike> a printer, <strike>an automatic sliding door</strike></b> and <b><strike>an Easy Order automatic ordering machine at McDonalds</strike></b>. The objective is to identify which needs (as scales) this device has for performing its primary function. Plus, we should consider which actions and external stimuli affect these scales (be specific, which action, sense or stimulus influences what need). We can then provide some scenarios / examples of how the device then "feels" at different states of its needs and how that influences its behaviour. Lastly, we are to indicate how it behaves like a creature.

							<br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212; 
              <h5>THE PRINTER</h5>
              While the influences may vary slightly amongst the various types of printers (office printer, home printer, printing shop printer, 3D-printers, sticker printers, laser cut printer) as a result of differences in environment and primary function, I took the basis of a printer's needs based off of my home printer.
              <br><br><img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/creatures/needs.gif" alt="">

              <br><br> Power and alignment is essentially a YES or NO need, entirely based on external stimuli. Connection through a cable is likewise but connection through WiFi is intermittent and reliant on the WiFi strength. As such, the printer responses in kind and may take pauses while printing. If it is having an extremely bad connection moment, it gives up and just spits out whatever it has printed cut off. With power, it behaves similar to that of sleeping. It makes noises before powering off and again when it is powering on. When alignment is not addressed, the printer periodically produces works with lines across the page as well as sporadically moves its ink catridges around, creating a ruckus. The ink dwindles &mdash; more so with the black than the tri-colour. When it does not get fed ink while it is low, it begins to choose the colours itself. For instance, getting documents worded in blue instead of black. Last but not least, paper is another of its sustenance. When paper is not placed neatly in its tray, it prints a crooked version of the work just for kicks. Additionally, if too thick a GSM of paper is used, it makes two markings with its roller for trying to squeeze the paper through. Subsequently, papers that are stuck together or whenever there is too much paper placed in the printer's tray, it just chews it up (paper jam). A printer behaves like a creature because it has needs (thinks) and respond (act) like a living being might. In its case, it is of a systematic and sticking to protocols (tolerates no nonsense) kind of nature.<br><br>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <p class="mb-5"> This topic utterly enthralls me! I find it to be mesmerizing as I have been fascinated with robotics for way too long. With the ever impressively compelling developments and immense growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it has become a strong controversial topic of debate where there are avid supporters of both sides to match. In a nutshell, some believe that the evolution of AI could result in job automation, the loss of human control, creation of unintended and unforeseen consequences as well as the highly exaggerated killer robots notion. On the other hand, others feel that AI robots would enhance lifestyles, significantly increase efficiencies as well as being a tremendous opportunity to extend and expand human creativity and ingenuity. Personally, I am a supporter of the latter. I have utmost curiosity and high hopes for the advancements of Artificial Creatures!

              <br><br> It is not that I am brushing aside the concerns society has on the topic but rather... I find that the main concerns raised by critics thus far are either moot or solvable. This topic is most valuable in the sense that it would increase productivity and quality of life tenfold in a broad range of fields. Its reach for possibilities of betterment will be limitless. Humans will learn to adapt to changes and embraces its gifts in time. From my research, I am baffled by what we are already able to conceive on this topic now. Hence, I predict that Artificial Creatures would make great bounds in the future worth watching out for with open minds. What will it mean to be human in the age of artificial intelligence? On this aspect, your guess is as good as mine. However, I am waiting with bated breath and optimistically hankering that I get to experience AI fully in my lifetime.<br><br>
