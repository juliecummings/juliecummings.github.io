        <p class="text-center"> Playful interactions are sources of emotion &mdash; potentially making the user feel, for example, stimulated, challenged, curious, proud, frustrated, happy, confused or sad. Some might say that playful interactions is the essence of video games. In this topic, we are more specifically looking at how <b>fun</b> can change our reactions and behaviours towards going through mundane tasks.<br><br>

        If this interests you, take a look at examples I found in my research, a mini conceptual assignment and my views on the topic. <br><br></p>

                Playful interactions, in this context, essentially involves the fun theory. Put simply, if you want to get people to change their behaviour, make what you want them to do novel and fun. The Fun Theory was an initiative of Volkswagen in 2009-2010 that was meant to acknowledge the thoughts, ideas and inventions that “proved” fun is the easiest way of changing behavior for the better. <br><br>There have been numerous attempts with this but the most prominent ones are as shared:

                </div>

              <br>As I was going through the array of experiments conducted by students and companies, I realize that they all tend to target a change in actions that are ordinarily dull and repetitive. Instances like commuting, disposing on waste or even grocery shopping. I suppose that is it is most effective to spark amusement. There are also a couple that are targeted at creating sustainable change like recycling. Examples include <i>drink-o</i>, <i>bottle bank arcade</i>, <i>whack-a-can recycle machine</i> and <i>COFFEE BIN</i>.
							<br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212; <br><br>

              Whilst idea generation in this theme can be plentiful, I wanted to delve deeper into those that I personally found interesting. Whilst looking at what it can mean for users and society as a whole, I am also curious as to why these fun-inciting playful interactions are not developed further.<br><br>

              <h5>DISCUSSION:</h5> <h4>WAITING AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS</h4>

							What could be a more mundane, dull and repetitive notion than waiting at traffic junctions for the light to turn green. As such, playful interactions incorporated to make it more entertaining in such a situation was attempted multiple times. Two of which I found particularly intriguing.<br><br>If you prefer, you can read up on the

              <b><a class="words" href="http://www.streetpong.info/" target="_blank">streetpong</a></b>.<br>Otherwise, the following videos depict how the concepts work when applied in real life.<br><br>

                </div>

              With the dancing traffic light, I cannot help but smile as I watched the video. People were enjoying participating /dancing but others were also amused with watching it mirrored in the traffic light. On the other hand, streetpong is only targeted at one individual on each side and is reliant on someone on the other side of the road wanting to play along. Due to this, street pong should only be implemented on busy crossings to prevent having no one of the other side of the road. However, targeting only one player on each side at busy intersections seems counter productive. On the other hand, the dancing traffic light's novelty is fleeting and so is the concept. With streetpong, there is at least some variation as with your opponent.<br><br>

              Regardless, both have the purpose of entertaining its users while the dancing traffic light amuses not just the user but everyone in the vicinity as well. However, I am fascinated with these two playful interactions because I find myself pondering over whether there is some way they can evolve with time to retain its wonder and novelty or are playful interactions always meant to be ephemeral?<br><br>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <p class="mb-5">In the lecture, the various types of play modus as well as the possibilities of playful interactions were discussed. Playful interactions have the potential to change behaviours and influence others positively in the world around us. As such, we were tasked with the assignment of coming up with a new concept for a social playful interface to encourage positive behaviour within the main THUAS building.

							<br><br> &#8212; &#9733; &#8212;
              <h5>CONCEPT</h5>
              The positive behaviour I wish to invoke is encouraging individuals that are repulsed by the idea of taking stairs instead of the lift. As I myself am a strong advocate of this aversion, I started pondering over what kind of playful interaction would have the best chance of edging me towards the using of stairs. Firstly, there should be others along the ride as habits are hard to form and more likely to succeed with support. Subsequently, as it is support that I am aiming for, it made more sense that it is a cooperative game first and foremost. However, a competitive aspect can possibly come into play between faculties or courses.
              <br><br><img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/playful/stairs.png" alt="">

              <br><br>
              The concept I settled on is game that can be incorporated into any stairwell other than the three open ones as it would hinder traffic flow. It involves installing a panel at each of the storeys of the building with buttons for choosing between 2 or 3 players and to which storey would one like to engage in. The accompanying play button sets the projection and sensors in motion. The objective is for all players to step onto the indicated spots on each step at the same time. If it is done in synchronism, the level will be green and a pleasant sound feedback will follow. If not, the step will turn red and a disruptive sound feedback will alert the players. To make sure that this does not hold up others too much as well as to make it more challenging, there is a time limit of 5 seconds before the next step is forfeited. At the end of the journey, there will be the highscores projected. If the players manage to claim a spot in the high score, their new entry will be included with 3 letters of choice.<br><br><br>

              <h5>INTERACTION</h5>
              THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY THREE MAIN INTERACTIONS:
              <br><br><img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/playful/context.png" alt="">

              <br><br><b>ONE.</b> (shown above) panel with a simple interface of buttons located on each storey, mapping out the number of players and flights of stairs in play before projection begins at the press of the 'play' button.
              <br><b>TWO.</b> (shown below) players (2 or 3) have to step on the allocated spots in synchronization and there is a 5seconds limit between steps before it is automatically forfeited. There is feedback on the success (or lack of) for each step through colour and sound. For instance, it could be along the lines of green for success and red otherwise as well as a melody unless interrupted by the off-key sound of failure.
              <br><b>THREE.</b> (shown above) display of existing highscores. Upon managing to break into the highscore board, the option of inputting three letters of choice will be provided.<br><br><br>

              <h5>PRODUCT</h5>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="img/topics/playful/game.png" alt="">

              <br><br><b>TYPE OF PLAY MODUS
              <br>&#8902; multiplayer and cooperative &#8902;</b>
              <br>play exists on the possibility of 2 to 3 players. While its main aim is to be cooperative with other players, there is a slight element of competition with the inclusion of a highscore display at the end.
              <br><b>&#8902; parallel and interdependent exertion &#8902;</b>
              <br>players have to mimic each other's actions which is possible as they are aware of each other's actions. Players then use a shared space and their bodies to act interdependently. 

              <br><br><b>HOW WILL IT WORK TECHNICALLY</b>
              <br><b>INPUT TECHNOLOGY:</b> There are buttons used to input the parameters of the projection such as the number of allocated slots on each step (2 or 3) and the scope of the space involved (number of flights of stairs) before starting the projection and game. Subsequently, touch sensors will be used to cover the area of the 5 spots on each step. More specifically, pressure sensors to know when it is stepped on or not. It works like that of buttons, just on a larger surface area. Once they are all pressed together, the system deems it as a success (similar to the concept of the Arduino Manual v5.0 exercise 10F).
              <br><b>OUTPUT TECHNOLOGY:</b> Projection, display, lights and sound. With the button panel at the start, the buttons light up to show the players their choice. For example, when you press '2-player' and '3rd storey), the corresponding buttons light up followed by a blinking 'play' button (indicating ability to start). Projection of the gamification then starts. As it is ongoing, steps change background colour (two options) and sound feedback (two options) based on whether it was successful or not. At the end, when the last step's outcome is computed, there is a display (could also be a projection) of high score and the option to input three letters if new highscore is attained.<br><br>

              <hr class="star-dark mb-5">
              <p class="mb-5"> I view this topic in high regards as I feel that technology could improve the ever-increasing mundance and clockwork life society is getting accustomed to. It can introduce some anarchy, figuratively, to the hum-drum quality of life. On the other hand, I realized through my research into the topic that there is an abundance of playful interactions out there on a small scale that did not proceed any further. While it could just be that playful interactions are meant to be novel and fleeting, this aspect saddens me.

              <br><br>Hence, I would really like to see more experimentations with playful interactions and hopefully, some that endure the test of time. After all, alterations, like changing out a variable or two, to the concept every now and then can still bring life back to its novelty. 

              <br><br>Plus, while looking up 'The Fun Theory', there were a lot done by user researchers observing how effective their product was in changing behaviours positively. Although these encourages me with regards to the future of playful interactions, there were never (or I am unable to locate) follow-ups to the testing or a more elaborately designed product. It is a shame as I conclude that the most valuable aspects of playful interactions are its ability to influence positive behaviour as well as FUN it brings in breaking the monotony. All in all, I am insufficiently equipped in speculating where playful interactions will lead due to my research not yielding much on its evolution thus far but I remain naïvely optimistic.<br><br>
